## Chest Rehaul
Very early version of the mod, as a sort of beta for people to try it out.
It currently only adds a new boss, Chest Mega, he spawns after defeating ???, but you are not required to fight him and you can go for the mega satan fight instead.
Even after the Chest Mega fight you still can fight mega satan since you get teleported back to the boss room after the fight.
Don't want to go to the chest to fight the boss? just spawn him with the debug menu.
